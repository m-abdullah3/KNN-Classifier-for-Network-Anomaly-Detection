# KNN-Classifier-for-Network-Anomaly-Detection
This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier in Python. We'll build models by varying training sizes (40%, 60%, 80%), K-values (1, 5, 15), and feature sets (all features, feature removal, random feature addition). We'll evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.
